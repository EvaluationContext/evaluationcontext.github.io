# Unlocking New Possibilities: Enhancing Power BI with SVGs

Tired of the limitations of standard Power BI visuals? Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are a versatile tool for enhancing reports beyond what is possible with the core Power BI visuals. 

This session will empower you to harness the full potential of SVGs, starting with a clear exploration of their underlying structure and key features, and demonstrating straightforward methods for seamless integration into your Power BI environment.

Discover how to forge a direct connection between your Power BI data and SVG elements to create insightful sparklines, interactive graphs, and more. We will analyze Microsoft's own implementation of Sparklines within Power BI, extracting valuable lessons in optimizing DAX measures for better performance. 

Finally, we will explore how leveraging more advanced SVG elements and techniques can significantly simplify and compact your SVG definitions, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and performant visuals.
